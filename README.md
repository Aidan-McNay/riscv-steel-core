## Project overview

**RISC-V Steel Core** is a free and open-source 32-bit RISC-V processor core for digital designs. With Steel you can create new RISC-V based embedded systems, microcontrollers and systems-on-chip.

**[Check out the Getting Started guide!](https://rafaelcalcada.github.io/steel-core/getting-started/)**

## Key features

- [x] `RV32I` + `Zicsr` + `Machine-level ISA` <br/>
- [x] 3-stage pipeline, in-order execution <br/>
- [x] Passes all [RISC-V Compatibility Test Framework v2.0](https://github.com/riscv-non-isa/riscv-arch-test) tests <br/>
- [x] Production-ready <br/>
- [x] Single [source file](riscv_steel_core.v) written in human-readable Verilog <br/>
- [x] Free and open-source ([MIT License](LICENSE.md))

## Documentation

The project has gone through significant changes recently, making the old docs obsolete. **New docs will be available soon.**

## History

Steel Core was developed for the author's final year project in college in 2020. The project goal was to help expand the adoption of the RISC-V architecture by creating a RISC-V core with the basic features to run embedded software that is simple to reuse.
