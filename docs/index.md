# Overview

## About Steel Core

Steel is a 3-stage single-issue in-order RISC-V microprocessor core designed to be simple and easy to use. It is intended for use in FPGAs as the processing unit in embedded systems projects.

**Key features:**

* Easy to use
* Targeted for use in FPGAs
* Implements the RV32I base instruction set + Zicsr extension
* M-mode privilege level support
* Hardware described in Verilog
* 3 pipeline stages
* Single-issue
* Fully documented
* Passed all RV32IZicsr tests from RISC-V test and compliance suites
* 0.46 CoreMarks / MHz
