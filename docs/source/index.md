Steel is a RISC-V processor core that implements the RV32I and Zicsr instruction sets of the RISC-V specifications. It is designed to be simple and easy to use.

## Key features

* Simple, easy to use
* Free, open-source
* RV32I base instruction set + Zicsr extension + M-mode privileged architecture
* 3 pipeline stages, single-issue
* Hardware described in Verilog
* Full documentation
* RISC-V compliant
* 1.36 CoreMarks/MHz
